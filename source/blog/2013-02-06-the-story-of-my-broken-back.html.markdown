#The Brave Story

**The Brave Foundation is a registered, non-profit Trust founded and staffed by Survivors of Serious Physical Trauma. ALL Brave support, services and therapy are available to anyone in RECOVERY from Physical Trauma, past or present, from early stages in hospital, at home or at the Brave Foundation and on A DONATION BASIS - for NO FIXED FEE.** Vouchers are sponsored by the Brave collective for those who cannot afford the recommended minimum donation.<br>
<br>
The Brave Foundation was initiated in April 2004 , by the founder, with the writing of the Brave manual for Recovery and the formation of the beginnings of a peer to peer Recovery Group - both in response to a need, experienced directly - while in Recovery.<br>
<br>
A need… for answers to the seemingly unanswerable, the very real, the previously unimaginable, the surreal and the practical. A need to be mentored, shown the way, given the simple explanations, understanding of alternatives - to know that there are any!<br>
<br>
Which beneficial regimes to practice, non-beneficial ones to avoid, choices and how to make them, advice that counts when your world has instantaneously shrunk – to a similarly small thin, white, pain infused marshmallow strip… we call a hospital bed.<br>
